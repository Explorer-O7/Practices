### -- Basic Probability --
**Task: In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.**
> `5/6`

### -- More Dice --
**Task: In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.**
> `1/9`

### -- Compound Event Probability --
**Task: There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.**
 - **Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.**
 - **Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.**
 - **Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.**

**One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?**
> `17/42`
